# SomePyRevitSnippets
Just various snippets of code for performing simple things in PyRevit which may help if you are learning. I am a new programmer so copy carefully and test everything before you rely on it. Things likely will not meet coding conventions, this is purely to give some examples of how I personally had various parts of my scripts working.

If you are on discord, we have an unofficial Autodesk community with dedicated channels for Revit API. Invite code is 7X58XHW
